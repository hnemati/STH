BUILDING
========

STRUCTURE
---------
The directory structure is as following:

* core                  Hypervisor code
* doc                   Documentation
* drivers               A short set of hardware drivers
* guests                Guests to be used with the hypervisor
* library               Shared code
* simulation            Simulation models and binaries
* templates             Hardware & script templates
* test                  Unit tests
* utils                 misc. utilities


COMPILING
---------
Assuming you have followed our START document and done a proper setup, just do

    make

This will use the targets defined in the file "target" (created during setup).

RUNNING
-------
Assuming you can run the target from your machine (e.g. a simulated target), dl

    make sim

This will create a number of files in core/build:
 * sth_PLATFORM.elf         Hypervisor ELF binary
 * sth_PLATFORM.bin         Hypervisor raw binary
 * sth_PLATFORM.asm         Hypervisor binary dissambled
 * sth_PLATFORM.img         Hypervisor image for use with u-boot etc
 
The above files do not include the guests. The following ones include guests binaries:
 * sth_beagleboard.fw       Hypervisor raw binary with the guest attached at the end
 * sth_beagleboard.fw.img   Same as above, in image format
