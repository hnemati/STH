	   Hence the whole buffer must be in [HAL_PHYS_START + 0x01000000, HAL_PHYS_START + 0x10000000) since the linux kernel's mapping starts at HAL_PHYS_START + 0x01000000

	   curr_vm->guest_info.phys_offset = PHYS_OFFSET = 0x81000000 (set in the kernel, which is 1 MiB from the start of actual physical RAM where the hypervisor and the

	   where the physical RAM starts and the latter is its size.

	   This latter check is incorrect since that means that RAM would end at offset 256 MiB + 16 MiB which is incorrect if BeagleBone White is used since it only has 256
	   MiB.

	   Hence the first check is the right one. Also frames always come from system RAM which justifies only RAM addresses. spruh73l says that the buffer pointer must be to
